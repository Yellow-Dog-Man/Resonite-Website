        <h1>Mod and Plugin Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: August 25th, 2025</p>
        <section>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Resonite users are <strong>allowed to</strong> develop, distribute, and install <a href="https://wiki.resonite.com/Plugins">plug-ins</a> and <a href="https://wiki.resonite.com/Mods">mods</a> (hereafter “modifications”), to modify and expand Resonite’s behavior. This policy details guidelines and policy involving them.</p>
            <h2 id="policy-adherence">Policy Adherence</h2>
            <p>All modifications and users using them must comply with other <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/index.html">existing policies</a>, in particular pay special attention to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/Guidelines.html">User Guidelines</a></li>
                <li>
                <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/TermsOfService.html">Terms of Service</a></li>
                <li>
                <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/EULA.html">EULA</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/Security.html">Security Policy</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Breaking these policies, with or without modifications, may lead to account restrictions or a termination of service.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="support">Support</h2>
            <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
            <p>For users of modifications, as these are created by 3rd parties, we are unable to provide support. We recommended reaching out to the creators of the modifications for support.</p>
            <h3 id="developers">Developers</h3>
            <p>For developers of modifications, we’re also unable to provide support currently.</p>
            <p>However, If you come across issues that you think we need to fix, we do still encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/new/choose">make an issue</a>. Please make your issues especially detailed and try to generalize things away from your specific code.</p>
            <p>This enables our team to isolate the issue from your modification.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="modification-guidance">Modification Guidance</h2>
            <p>While our <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/index.html">other policies</a> outline things in detail, we want to highlight some specific items for clarity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Asset Protection Circumvention
                <ul>
                    <li>Anything that circumvents our asset protections is <strong>not allowed</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Moderation Circumvention
                <ul>
                    <li>Anything that circumvents either platform or session moderation is <strong>not allowed</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Abusing Security Issues
                <ul>
                    <li>Anything that takes an existing or potential security issue and uses it is <strong>not allowed</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Respect Other Users
                <ul>
                    <li>Anything that adversely affects other user's experiences or sessions is <strong>not allowed</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once again, anything that breaks our <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/index.html">other policies</a> is <strong>not allowed</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="distribution-guidance">Distribution Guidance</h2>
            <p>As covered in our <a href="https://resonite.com/policies/EULA.html">EULA</a>, redistribution of Resonite, FrooxEngine, or any of its components is not allowed. However, there are some exceptions that we've made to aid modification developers.</p>
            <h3 id="reference-assemblies">Reference Assemblies</h3>
            <p>We allow the distribution of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/reference-assemblies">Reference Assemblies</a> created by modification developers.</p>
            <p>This also includes items that can be generated from these assemblies such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IPC Bindings</li>
                <li>Interface/Struct Layouts</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We hope to publish official reference assemblies with each build in the future. This would likely be a part of <a href="https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/1212">Molecule</a></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
            <p>Any of our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Yellow-Dog-Man/repositories">open source components</a> are exactly that: open source. Ensure the license for each individual open source component is adhered to.</p>
            <h2 id="alternative-renderers">Alternative Renderers</h2>
            <p>Provided you comply with all other policies, you are allowed to make custom/alternative renderers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>

            <p>If you have questions, please <a href="https://wiki.resonite.com/Contact_Us">Contact Us</a>.</p>
