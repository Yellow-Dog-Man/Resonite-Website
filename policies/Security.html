        <h1>Security Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: October 8th 2023</p>

        <p>Resonite and Yellow Dog Man Studios, take security very seriously. To find out our policy on security and security reporting please read on.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Reportable Issues</h2>
            <p>When it comes to security we're generally looking for the following items.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal Data Breaches</li>
                <li>Unauthorized access to user's computers or data</li>
                <li>Cloud based security issues</li>
                <li>Permission system breaches and bypasses</li>
                <li>Asset theft/ripping including Avatars and Worlds</li>
                <li>Malicious or self-replicating items</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is not an exhaustive list and you should use your best judgement when making a report. If an issue bothers you please consider reporting it. We would rather know about an issue then not.</p>

            <h3>Crashes</h3>
            <p>As Resonite is a Beta/Early Access product, crashes are common and in some cases random. It is therefore ok to report these on our bug tracker.</p>

            <p>However, if a crash is easily reproducible or easy to accidentally trigger, then a private report as a security issue is still valid.</p>

            <p>Additionally, If a user is maliciously causing crashes please also submit that to our <a href="https://moderation.resonite.com">Moderation System</a>.</p>

            <h3>Private Data</h3>
            <p>Due to our Peer to Peer infrastructure for sessions and flexibility/openness of in-session development, it can be unclear what we class as private data.</p>

            <p>To clarify this, here is a list of common data that we <strong>don't</strong> consider private:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Username</li>
                <li>User ID</li>
                <li>Machine ID (This is <strong>not</strong> a MAC address)</li>
                <li>IP Address</li>
                <li>Steam ID/Username (When Steam networking sockets or rich presence is used)</li>
                <li>Discord ID/Username (When Discord rich presence is used)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Reporting Security Issues</h2>

            <h2>Reporting format/contents</h2> 
            <p>We don't have a standard format, but when reporting an issue be sure to include as much detail as possible. Try to include:</p>

                <li>What you found?</li>
                <li>How you found it?</li>
                <li>How serious you think it is?</li>
                <li>How many users are aware of it?</li>
                <li>Log Files</li>

            </ul>
            <p>You should also indicate if you'd like to opt out of being credited for this report / discovery. When we resolve issues we may credit you in the change logs unless you opt out.</p>
