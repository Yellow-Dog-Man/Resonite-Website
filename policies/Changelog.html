        <h1>Policy Changelog</h1>
        <p>For transparency, a list of changes to our polices are presented here.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>September 11th 2024 - Privacy Policy Corrections</h2>
            <p>We have corrected our privacy policy to better reflect our collection of sensitive data, such as the collection of date of birth, and receiving data from third party sources.</p>
            <p>This better reflects our current data practices - particularly for the purpose of moderation.</p>

            <h2>June 8th 2024 - Content Licenses</h2>
            <p>We have added our content licenses as a policy page to further clarify how we license our content made for the Resonite platform for our users and other content creators.</p>
            <p>This includes exceptions to our standard content license, for example content made by team members for personal projects or unless otherwise specified for a piece of content.</p>

            <h2>February 14th 2024 - User Guidelines</h2>
            <p>We have made a small wording tweak to our user guidelines, in order to provide additional clarity on our adult content guidelines. The changed text is displayed below, but can also be reviewed on <a href="https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Website/blob/main/policies/Guidelines.html">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>18th October 2023 - Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>We've updated the language in our Terms of Service in section 2 Intellectual Property rights. We've removed some language relating to the license grants on contents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We've removed the "Sell" and "Resell" license grant. Resonite does not currently sell or resell your contributions. Future features on our roadmap may require re-adding this but we'll work with you to communicate and overhaul our policies at this time.</li>
                <li>We've removed wording that referred to "exploit"-ing your contributions. This language that caused some rightful alarm and is not necessary as the other grants cover our use-cases.</li>
                <li>We've removed clauses relating to users being able to access Resonite if they are under 16 with parental supervision. We have no way to store or verify this information at this time so cannot support it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5th January 2024 - EULA</h2>
            <p>We've updated the language in our EULA, section 6.8</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We've added "including any relevant local, national, or international law." to the end of this line. This asks users to ensure they are taking in account the law in many areas before submitting content.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
